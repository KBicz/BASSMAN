# BASSMAN

BASSMAN (Best rAndom StarSpots Model calculAtioN) is the software to model the starspots on selected stars using photometry from the TESS satellite. The software is written in Python 3 by K. Bicz. For more details, see the paper on [Bicz et al. 2022](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7ab3).

The software to work properly needs MacOS or Linux (for more advanced users WSL will also work). To install the software you can use executable files in the direcory with data or put them in the folder where the enviromental wariable is added to the path. You have to put files claretld.dat and TESS_stars_params.dat to the /usr/local/bin/ folder. To install all of the needed libraries for Python run the install_python_modules.sh script.
